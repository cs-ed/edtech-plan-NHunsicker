## Context

### Course

The course I will be teaching is a grades 6 through 8 elective titled "Introduction to Coding". This course will focus on introducing the basics of programming using the Ozaria curriculum and the python language. There will be modules delving into the following concepts:
- Algorithms
- Debugging
- Impacts of Computing
- Variables
- Conditionals
- Networks and the Internet
- Loops
- Computing Systems
- Data and Analysis
- Functions

This course will be taught as a single year long elective meeting 3 days per week for 55 minutes per day.

### Situation

Chico Country Day School is a K-8 charter school located in Chico, CA. Our middle school has approximately 180 students. Historically our middle school has had a robotics elective that is no longer taught. The purpose of this elective is to provide a similar outlet for students that are interested in developing computer science skills. Our school also has an esports team that has competed in capture the flag style hacking competitions in the past, though we have not competed in one since 2019. It is hoped that this elective will also help support a return to these competitions. There are also coding esports opportunities provided by the company that produces Ozaria.

We will not have a dedicated computer lab. As such, students in this elective will be using chromebooks to complete the coursework. **Chico Country Day has one to one chromebook access for all students.** I believe that our class size will be between 10 and 28 students. Class size will be determined by student interest, the maximum size of other electives, and budget constraints.

At Chico Country Day electives are the last class period of the day on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday afternoons. It is projected that we will have approximately 90 electives meetings within a school year and the selected curriculum is made up of 85 lessons. This will leave room for 1 or 2 field trips and/or space to provide additional work time if necessary.

## Plan

### Software Specifications

#### Operating Systems

The teacher of this course could use any of the options below. Any operating system that would be comfortable to use daily on a PC would be fine for this course. **The primary website used for this course does NOT support *iOS* or *Android*. It is unclear whether touch input is supported.** It is expected that students will be using chromebooks since students are provided access to chromebooks.

1. **Microsoft Windows** - The school assigned laptop runs Microsoft Windows 10. This will likely only be used for presentation of any in class material and planning.

2. **Ubuntu 20.04 and 22.04** - Some amount of planning will be completed on this device. In the event that we go into distance learning I will transition to doing all of my presentations and planning from and on this OS.

3. **Chrome OS** - The students will be using chromebooks provided by the school. If we go into distance learning, then chromebooks will be checked out to families.
   
#### Specific Software

**OBS Studio** allows extensive control over the webcam since it can be used as a software defined webcam. This software also allows the teacher to compose scenes that can be used as a webcam and also to record videos for distribution to students who are working asynchronously.

#### Websites

The vast majority of the work that we do will be completed in websites. It is expected that students will not need to use software outside of their web browser to complete this course.

1. **Ozaria** - This will be the primary website that students will interact with in this course. Ozaria presents itself as a role playing game where you use python to complete various tasks and build things. This website also provides teacher resources that should allow a teacher without a background in computer science to effectively run this course. It is likely that we will finisht his curriculum within the school year.

3. **Altitude Learning** - Altitude is our school adopted learning management system. I will use this software to push out instructions to students who may be absent or in quarantine.

4. **Google, Google Scholar, wikipedia, and Google Slides** - Some of the lessons are discussion based and don't have students interacting directly with Ozaria. In these lesson's we'll utilize Slides to help guide our discussions. We will also utilize Google, Google Scholar, and wikipedia to learn about the concepts presented in these lessons.

5. **Go Guardian** - During students interactive work on Ozaria I will need to monitor the class with Go Guardian. Go Guardian allows me to see what students are up to and limit off task behaviors.

6. **Google Meet and Google Jamboard** - In the event that we go into distance learning I will use these tools to interact with students online. I have had more success with Google Meet than I have had with Zoom especially when integrating Google Jamboard.


### Hardware Specifications

#### Teacher Hardware

Any computer capable of running **modern browsers** and with ideally at least **4 GB of RAM**. Currently I plan on using my school provided laptop which exceeds these capabilities and my home PC that also exceeds these requirements. Specific requirements for the teacher's pc are lenient, but these requirements depend on many variables. The current teacher laptop features a core i5 cpu and 16GB of ram. The teacher's home PC has a core i7 and 32GB of ram.

#### Classroom Hardware

Additional hardware and infrastructure should not be necessary to run this elective at Chico Country Day.

1. The school currently has wifi available throughout the school. The internet connection appears to go through comcast at some point based upon traceroute command. Speed tests indicate that the speed should be more that sufficient for a class full of students working on this elective. A **minimum of 200 Kbps bandwidth per student is required for Ozaria to function**, though bandwidth in excess of 1 Mbps is recommended.

2. Wired computer mice will be available to students who would prefer not to use touchpads.

3. Use of a wall mounted television that will be used to display content for the entire class during discussions. A projector could also be used for this purpose.

4. A white board and accessories for writing pseudocode and making lists of ideas from discussions is also necessary.

#### Student Hardware

Students will use chromebooks. All chromebooks that the school has, and issues to distance learners, exceed the specifications to run Ozaria. Ozaria's primary instruction about chromebooks is that any **chromebooks with only 2GB of RAM may experience minor graphics issues in later units**.

### Application

#### Overall Class Structure

Classes will be a mixture of whole class discussion, small group discussion and research, and individual practice.

1. Most topics and lessons will be introduced in a whole class discussion format. We will use slides provided by the curriculum, and modified by the teacher, to help guide us during this time. Many topics will also end with us returning to this format for a recap of the skills that we practiced. This format should present an opportunity to front load any prior knowledge that students will need and also close with a recap of what the big ideas of the lesson were. We will be displaying these slides on a television or projector using the teacher computer.

2. Some lessons will have students working in groups to research ideas and concepts. These groups will then bring their findings back to the class for discussion. During this period of time students will be using chromebooks to do this research. It is anticipated that students will start with google, google scholar, or wikipedia and branch into other sources as necessary during this time. During this period of time the teacher will monitor go guardian for off task behaviors while also moving between groups to help guide discussions.

3. Most lessons involve some amount of practice through Ozaria. During some lessons students may end up working in pairs on these assignments. It is anticipated that some of the more advanced students will voluntarily mentor other students during this time as well. The curriculum also includes extension acitivities for students that finish early during these periods of time. Students will use chromebooks for this work. Students may also choose to use personal headphones during this period of time to make their interactions with Ozaria more immersive. During this period of time the teacher will monitor go guardian for off task behaviors while seekings out students who may need more 1 on 1 intervention and scaffolding. 

4. Each chapter has a capstone project which can be used as a summative assessment. The curriculum provides solutions and grading rubrics for teachers who do not have a computer science background.

#### Typical Class Work Flow

Most lessons will take two days to complete. The first day of a lesson will start with a review of the last session and then primarily focus on whole class discussion of the primary concepts ofthe lesson. Google slides will help guide the discussion with day to day examples of where concepts are seen. For example, when introducing problem decomposition we will look at the "sub-goals" necessary to bake and decorate a cake. After looking at real world examples, we will look at examples within Ozaria. For example, when looking at debugging we will look at how errors in our code show up Ozaria. In many lessons there will be opportunities for small groups to work together to further their understanding of the concepts through discussion and graphic organizers.

The second day of most lessons will focus on completing levels in Ozaria. Students will work at their own pace through the assigned levels of Ozaria. During this period of time students will be able to consult with and advise each other. The teacher will move through the room answering questions and supporting students when necessary. The last 10 minutes of class will reflect on what they did, what they noticed, and what was challenging. These reflections will be kept as a journal across the class so that students can see what they've learned. It is expected that the teacher will conduct formative assessments during these sessions by observing students' work. Students who are unable to complete a level successfully are unable to move forward with the next level. The current level students are at, comparison to a known solution, and viewing number of attempts to successfully complete a level can all be factored into formative asessment.

#### Additional Assignment Considerations and School Culture

It is not anticipated that any homework will be assigned, though it is plausible that we would take 1 or 2 field trips that may require permission slips. While not explicitly against the rules, homework within an elective seems like it would be considered outside of the norm. At Chico Country Day homework is not typically assigned outside of math practice and assigned readings for English class.

It is not projected that we will have other types of assignments in this class.

Assessments will be handled within Ozaria itself. The teacher will be able to see student submissions within Ozaria and teachers lacking a background in computer science can compare answers to an answer key. Generally Ozaria will not let a student proceed to another task until they've successfully completed all prior tasks. At Chico Country Day we do not include grades for electives. Currently our learning management system, Altitude, does not appear to include the computer science standards, so there will be no reporting of grades. **Assessment will be solely used to determine when to move into more advanced topics.** Accountability is typically handled with direct parent contact when necessary and removal from the elective in extreme cases.

### Impacts

#### Modifications and Accommodations for students with an IEP or 504

Modifications and accommodations may be necessary to overcome the needs of some students.

- The curriculum and software provides immediate and direct feedback to students both visually and with audio cues. Students who are visually impaired may struggle in this course as the curriculum does not appear to function without viewing a graphical display. Despite this, the curriculum does provide alternate offline versions of the lessons. **In the event that a visually impaired student takes this class I believe that it would be possible, with assistance of an education specialist, to modify the majority of the curriculum for some form of offline physical interaction.**

- While there is extensive reading in the curriculum and software, **all instructions within the software seem to also be given verbally.** A student with dyslexia or a dyslexia adjacent specific learning disability would have access to the instructions in multiple formats. **It may be necessary to use speech recognition software for students with some learning disabilities.**

- It is not projected that other accommodations for modifications will be necessary, though it is anticipated that some students will require more direct instruction, scaffolding, and intervention than is typical. None of the software or technology listed within this section is included elsewhere in this document because it is anticipated that those pieces of technology will already be in place for the student for general education coursework.

#### Transition to Distance Learning Model

All electives were suspended when Chico Country Day transitioned to distance learning in March of 2020. Electives were started again only when it returned to full capacity at the beginning of the 2021-2022 school year. **It is anticipated that electives will be suspended again if Chico Country Day transitions back to distance learning.** In the event that Chico Country Day transitions to distance learning, it is possible that **this elective could transition to a school sanctioned and funded "club".**

- For synchronous distance learning the teacher would meet with students 3 times per week to introduce concepts and tasks and then have students work through the task while maintaining a google meet link for students who need additional guidance during their task.

- For asynchronous learning the teacher would record videos demonstrating new skills and short videos of lecture on topics. Students would work on tasks at their own pace emailing the teacher with questions and to set up 1 on 1 and small group google meet sessions.

It is projected that the transition to distance learning for this elective would be much easier to accomplish than a typical general education class and that the computerized nature of this class would adapt well to either distance learning model. It is unclear if a teacher without a background in computer science could successfully complete this transition.

#### Ethical and Social Issues

These issues are immediately apparent. It is possible to mitigate some of these issues, but some of these issues may be unsolveable.

1. Electives are taught as quarter or semester lengths at Chico Country Day. In the first and last quarter of the year 8th grade gets priority for choosing their electives. In the second quarter 7th grade gets priority and in the third semester 6th grade gets priority. With a year long elective, students in 6th and 7th grade may not end up having access to the elective. It is projected that the class will not be entirely full of 8th grade students, but this structure does create equity issues. This can be somewhat alleviated by running this elective for multiple years in a row, but **there will always be a group of younger students who may end up being excluded if this elective doesn't run each year.**

2. **Students who have fallen behind in general education classes are often pulled from electives to complete work for general education.** This could create situations that would cause students to fall behind in this elective without doing course work as homework. **It is unclear if there is a work around for solving this issue.** In the event that Chico Country Day decides to pursue this course a dilemma protocol meeting will likely be needed to determine how to solve this issue.

3. **Future electives are often planned only one quarter in advance.** This can lead to situations where students feel like they cannot sign up for a long elective or end up wanting to leave a long term commitment elective. Releasing students from longer electives has always been done at the discretion of the teacher, but **it is unclear what this impact could be with the school paying a subscription fee for students to participate in this elective.**

4. **Students at Chico Country Day only get one elective at a time.** Since students only have one elective at a time, it is not possible for students taking this course to take other equally exciting courses. There is likely a possiblity to run a "club" version of this elective as well, but the instructor for this course doesn't currently have the capacity to take on additional responsibilities for the school.
